    <h2>Chef John's Falafel</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Falafel are deliciously crispy deep-fried fritters made with chickpeas that are rarely attempted at home but are actually very simple to make. Even a relative novice like me can get some very decent results. You do need to know you're going to have a craving for falafel a full day before you actually want to eat it so you can soak the chickpeas. Serve with my tahini or tzatziki sauce and pita bread.</p>    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place dried chickpeas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 12 to 24 hours. Drain.</li>
        <li>Blend chickpeas, onion, parsley, garlic, flour, lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until mixture is finely ground and holds together when pressed.</li>
        <li>Transfer falafel mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors blend, 1 to 2 hours. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide falafel mixture into 12 portions and roll each with moistened hands to form a ball.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
    </ol>
